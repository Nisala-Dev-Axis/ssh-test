# Multiple Github account configuration

This repo is meant for testing out the multiple Github account configuration using SSH keys.

# About
Managing multiple Github accounts on one device can get quite tricky as it requires you to reconfigure account settings on your device or your IDE. That's why most applications like source tree provide the ability to configure multiple accounts on one device. Even though these applications exist, sometimes you just want to use github from any where(commandline, sourcetree, etc) and still want to get the same results. This is where SSH comes into play.
